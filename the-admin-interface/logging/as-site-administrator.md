# As Site Administrator

During the installation of XOOPS you were asked to input an 'Admin name' and 'Admin password' Both these strings are case sensitive and should be used to login to your site as 'site administrator'. A site administrator has unrestricted access to the site and allows entry to the website administration section, as well as the normal registered user section. Both usernames and passwords may be changed in the administration&gt;edit user section. Make certain your login strings are unique and secure, as they will grant access to any user who inputs them!

Once logged in as administrator a new menu section appears in your home page sidebar with a link to 'Site administration'. This link appears because of your login status as administrator and is the link to the main control center for your site. It is possible to promote any registered user to site administration level, though for security reasons this is usually assigned to select trusted personnel only.

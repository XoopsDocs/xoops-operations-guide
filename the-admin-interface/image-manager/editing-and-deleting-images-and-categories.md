# Editing and deleting images and categories

Once you have created some categories they will appear at the top of the image manager page in the system module. Each category has three Actions associated with it:

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **View:** | This will display a list of the images in the category, along with their details. You can edit the name, display order of images here. You also have the option to reassign images to a different category, to show or hide them, and to delete them. |
| **Edit:** | This opens the configuration options for the category so that you can change them. |
| **Delete:** | Select delete to remove a category. If you are storing images as binary blobs in the database this will delete them permanently. If you are storing images as files in the 'uploads' directory, your images will still be in the that directory \(though they wonâ€™t be available through image manager\). |

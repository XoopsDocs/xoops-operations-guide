# Adding and editing smilies

You can add more smilies to your system using the form at the bottom of the page \(there are many websites where you can obtain new ones\). Simply enter a shortcut code for your new smile \(this should be unique\), a name for it, select the file you want to upload using the browse button, and decide whether or not you want it to be one of those displayed on submission forms. Select ‘submit’ to upload it. Clicking on the ‘edit’ link for an existing smarty will open up a form with the same options. You can even replace the image file if you want.

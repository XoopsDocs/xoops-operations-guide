# Word Censoring Options

XOOPS can automatically censor undesirable words that may be posted by visitors to your site and replace them with a generic, alternative term of your choice. The censorship function does consume some system resources and may slow your site somewhat. It is disabled by default.

To implement censorship on your site select the ‘enable’ radio button. You need to enter a list of unwanted words in the ‘words to censor’ box, separating them with the pipe character. This function is case insensitive. Enter a suitable replacement term in the ‘replace bad words with’ box. The default is \#OOPS\#.

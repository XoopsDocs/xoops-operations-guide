# Control panel home

Having logged in successfully as a site administrator you are now shown a new menu called ‘user menu’ in the home page. Click on the link ‘Administration menu’. This link is unique to you the Webmaster, or site administrator, as we shall refer to in these pages. Click this link to open your Control panel home page!

The control panel home page is the nerve centre for your whole site. You will certainly be spending many happy hours here creating content and administrating, so take some time to become familiar with the functions and facilities available. That ‘rather empty home page’ will soon take on the appearance and usefulness of a truly professionally built Website, providing you plan thoughtfully and experiment with care and some background knowledge.

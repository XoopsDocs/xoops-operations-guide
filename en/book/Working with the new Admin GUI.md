## 2.3 Working with the new Admin GUI (our Dashboard)

XOOPS 2.5 has as a default a new Admin GUI – the “Oxygen”, developed by Voltan (Hossien Azizabadi), and which is based on EXM created by Bit3CR0 (Eduardo Cortés).

Our new Dashboard is a major move forward toward improved ease of use for XOOPS users, with nice GUI and clear pull-down menus, as well with System Information and helpful Tabs.
1) On the very top you see a Toolbar (1) with several buttons:

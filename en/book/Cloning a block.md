### 2.6.4	Cloning a block

The last block feature that we want to cover is cloning a block. Sometimes, we would like to have a block that is a variation of an existing block, so the question is – how can we “reuse” the existing one? It is done by cloning. As shown above, as part of every block there is an icon to clone the block: ![img_54.jpg](../assets/img_58.jpg)  

So let’s clone the Theme Block. After clicking on the “Clone” icon, we’ll get the block configuration screen. Let’s only change the name of the block and make it visible:

![img_54.jpg](../assets/img_66.jpg)
 
And let’s see the user side:

![img_54.jpg](../assets/img_67.jpg) 	
 	
As you can see on the left, both blocks are working just fine. Of course, you can make more significant changes/modifications to the cloned block.

This creates an account that the client can login to view the current status of their banner advertisements:

| Field | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Client Name: | Normally the name of the company. |
| Contact Name: | Your contact at the company. |
| Contact Email: | 	Make sure you get this right. A summary of current banner statistics will be sent to this address when the client requests a status report (see ‘Client banner accounts’ below). |
| Client Login: | Assign a login name for your client here. You will have to inform clients of their login and password manually. This is entirely separate from the main site login system. |
| Client Password: | Assign a password for your client’s account here. The client cannot change this. Pick something secure. |
| Extra Info: | 	A discretionary ‘notes’ field, enter anything you like in here. |


Clients can check the status of their banners at any time by visiting http://www.yoururl.com/banners.php. This presents a login screen where the client must enter their login and password (assigned by you via the ‘add client’ form).

After login, clients are presented with a table summarising their banner statistics (described in ‘Current active banners’ above), and a display of their currently running banners. The ‘Email Stats’ link enables the client to send the current report, marked with a timestamp, to their contact email address. The client can re-point the banner to any URL they choose via the ‘Change URL’ box. This enables them to redirect the focus of their advertisement as needed.

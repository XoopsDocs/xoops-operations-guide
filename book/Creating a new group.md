### 2.8.4	Creating a new group

The final option you have is to create new group. 

You can do it by clicking on the “Add new Group” button: ![img_76.jpg](../assets/img_76.jpg)  

The Create a New Group section displays a familiar table that you have already seen in [Figure 15] showing all the modules and blocks installed in the system. Notice they are listed against empty check boxes, until you assign the settings for the new group.

Enter a name and description for the new group. Assign rights and access for each module and block displayed, by filling the check boxes in the same way as the four default groups previously.

At the bottom you will see a button for 'Submit', click this to create the new group you have defined in the page.

Your new group will now appear in the list of groups throughout the site administration pages. Note that the newly created group does not have any members yet. You’ll have to click Modify and add the users you want in the group, as seen on section 2.8.3.
